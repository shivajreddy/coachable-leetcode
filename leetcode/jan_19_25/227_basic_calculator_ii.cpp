#include <string>

using std::string;

/*
Observations: 
- skip spaces

Initial Thoughts:
- stack to track of number(could be multiple digits), so keep storing in string,
  and convert to int only when we hit a symbol

- BODMAS: Bracket, Order of powers, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
- Main idea of the problem : how to undo  (+ or -) when we encounter (* or /)
- we should treat + and - as same operation, similary * and /
  because these operations are inverse of each other

Approach:
- Instead of using a stack to manage numberes nad operations, we can use variables
  prev_num : track the last computed value for higher-precedence operations
- Addition & Subtraction directly update the result.
- Multiplication & Division modify the 'prev_num' to "undo" their effect
  when a lower-precedence operation is encountered.

Core Idea:
   - The main challenge is handling the precedence of * and / over + and -
   - To achieve this:
     - Treat + and - as a single operation (low precedence).
     - Treat * and / as a single operation (high precedence).
   - When encountering * or /, adjust 'prev_num' without immediately updating the 'result'.
   - For + and -, finalize the previous operation by adding 'prev_num' to 'result' and resetting 'prev_num'.

Processing the String:
   - Iterate through the string, handling characters based on their type:
     - Digit: Parse and accumulate the current number.
     - Operator: Perform the appropriate calculation based on the current operation.
     - End of String: Add the last number (`prev_num`) to the result.
